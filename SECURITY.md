If you do not get a response within 7-days we ask that you please send us another email after 1-week and continue to do so until we respond.

We ask the following of you during this time
* That you remain active in the community as you may be called upon for further elaboration and collaboration.
*  That you refrain from disclosing the vulnerability to any other entity.

If you do not hear from any of the maintainers for over 1-month **OR** 3-weeks **AND** after a minimum of 2 repeated email reports from your initial email (totalling 3 reports), we ask that you post an issue on GitHub following the same format as above. You will also be free to disclose the vulnerability to other entities as well. This is a last resort effort to at least alert the community to issues.

If we respond to your report we will be as honest and open as we can about how we are going to approach the situation and how long it may take us to solve it. We ask that you respect our honesty and do not share any information that we will disclose with you until we approve.

<sub>Thank you for taking the time to read this report. If you have any questions comments or concerns regarding this report please contact staticBanter via email at staticbanter@staticblogs.ca.</sub>
